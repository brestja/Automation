### N8n is an open-source automation platform that allows users to create bots for various applications, including Telegram. With n8n, users can create a bot that can retrieve data from popular cryptocurrency websites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and provide this information to users on Telegram through the use of commands.

###To create a n8n bot for Telegram that gets information from CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, users would first need to set up a Telegram bot and obtain a bot token. They would then need to create a new n8n workflow and add a Telegram trigger node, which will listen for commands from users.

###Next, the user would need to add nodes for CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko to the workflow, which will allow the bot to retrieve data from these websites. The user can then configure these nodes to retrieve specific information, such as the current price of a cryptocurrency or its market cap.

###Once the nodes are set up, the user can add a Telegram response node to the workflow, which will send the retrieved data back to the user on Telegram. The user can customize the response to include the information they want and format it in a way that is easy to understand.

###With this setup, users can use commands to query the bot and receive real-time data from CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko on Telegram. For example, they could use the command "/price BTC" to get the current price of Bitcoin, or "/marketcap ETH" to get the market cap of Ethereum.
