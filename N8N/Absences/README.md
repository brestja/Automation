## Absences App

### An app that notifies employees about absences in Slack can help teams stay informed and organized. The app could work by integrating with a company's attendance management system and sending daily notifications to a designated Slack channel with a list of employees who will be absent that day.

### To set up the app, the user would first need to connect the attendance management system to Slack and select the channel where the notifications will be sent. The app could then automatically send a message at a specified time each day, listing the names of the employees who will be absent.

### The app could also allow users to customize the notifications, such as by choosing which absences to include (e.g. only scheduled vacations or all absences) and how the names are displayed (e.g. by name or username).

### With this app, employees can quickly and easily stay up to date on who will be absent each day, which can help them plan and coordinate their work accordingly. The app can also help managers and team leads track absences and ensure that they have adequate coverage for important tasks and projects.
