## GitHub WebHook
### n8n is an open-source, low-code automation platform that allows users to create workflows, known as "nodes," to automate processes and connect various applications and services. With n8n, users can create a workflow that retrieves notifications from a GitHub webhook and sends them to a Slack channel.

### To do this, the user would first need to set up a webhook on their GitHub repository to trigger the workflow whenever a specified event, such as a commit or pull request, occurs. They would then use the n8n platform to create a node that listens for the webhook and retrieves the notification data.

### Next, the user would create another node to send the notification data to a Slack channel, using the Slack API to post the message. The user can customize the message format and the Slack channel where the notifications will be sent.

### Overall, the n8n app allows users to easily automate the process of retrieving and sending GitHub webhook notifications to Slack, saving time and effort.
